# Quantum Hybrid Hyperoptimization

This project aims to solve the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) using various quantum hybrid algorithms. The TSP is a well-known combinatorial optimization problem that asks: "Given a list of cities and the distances between each pair of cities, what is the shortest possible route that visits each city exactly once and returns to the origin city?".

## Algorithms Used

The project uses the following quantum hybrid algorithms:

1. Quantum Genetic Algorithm
2. Quantum Convex Hull Algorithm
3. Quantum Annealing
4. Quantum A* Algorithm

Each algorithm is implemented in Python using the Qiskit library for quantum computing.

## Project Structure

The project is structured as follows:

- `Quantum_Genetic_Algothrim.py`: This file contains the implementation of the Quantum Genetic Algorithm for the TSP.
- `Quantum_Convex.py`: This file contains the implementation of the Quantum Convex Hull Algorithm for the TSP.
- `Quantum_Annealing.py`: This file contains the implementation of Quantum Annealing for the TSP.
- `Quantum_A.py`: This file contains the implementation of the Quantum A* Algorithm for the TSP.

## Running the Code

To run the code, you need to have Python and Qiskit installed. You can install Qiskit using pip:

```bash
pip install qiskit
```

Then, you can run each file separately using Python. For example, to run the Quantum Genetic Algorithm, you can use:

```bash
python Quantum_Genetic_Algothrim.py
```

## Results

The results of the algorithms are visualized using matplotlib. Each algorithm plots the best route found and the fitness over generations.
