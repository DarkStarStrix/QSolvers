The Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) is a well-known combinatorial optimization problem in computer science and operations research. 
It asks the following question: "Given a list of cities and the distances between each pair of cities, what is the shortest possible route that visits each city exactly once and returns to the origin city?".

The TSP is an NP-hard problem in computational complexity theory, meaning that it is computationally difficult to find an optimal solution for large instances. 
However, many heuristics and exact algorithms have been developed to solve the TSP efficiently. 
Some instances with tens of thousands of cities can be solved completely, and even problems with millions of cities can be approximated within a small fraction of 1%1.

The TSP has several applications in various fields such as planning, logistics, microchip manufacturing, DNA sequencing, astronomy, and more. 
It is used as a benchmark for testing optimization methods and appears as a sub-problem in many areas.
