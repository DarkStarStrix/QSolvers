# Explanation of the bosonic solvers

## Introduction to the bosonic solvers

## what is bosonic solvers?
Bosonic solvers are a set of quantum algorithms that use bosonic systems aka Bose Einstein condensates to solve problems. These solvers are used to solve problems that are difficult to solve using classical computers. They are used in various fields such as finance, cryptography, and machine learning. The solvers are implemented using quantum-inspired algorithms and quantum computing libraries such as qutip, qiskit
to solve problems that are difficult to solve using classical computers. The solvers are used in various fields such as finance, cryptography, and machine learning and even chemistry and modeling of physical systems.

## why bose einstein condensates?
simple bosonic systems are used because they are easier to control and manipulate than other quantum systems. They are also more stable and less prone to errors. This makes them ideal for solving problems that are difficult to solve using classical computers.
though still in the experimental phase of engineering, the bosonic solvers are expected to revolutionize the way we solve problems in various fields.
these are some of the solvers that are implemented using bosonic systems.
and more are to come in the future.

## Bosonic-cryptography 
The provided Python code is a script that visualizes the process of HSHH Cryptography using 3D vectors and quantum-inspired transformations. It uses the libraries numpy for numerical operations, plotly for 3D visualization, and qutip for quantum computations.  
The script starts by defining two functions: xor_operation and quantum_transformation. 
The xor_operation function takes two vectors as input and returns the result of the XOR operation on these vectors. The quantum_transformation function takes an input vector and a scalar, and returns the vector obtained by multiplying each element of the input vector by the scalar.
```python
def xor_operation(vector_a, vector_b):
    return np.logical_xor (vector_a, vector_b)

def quantum_transformation(input_vector, input_scalar):
    transformed_vector = np.array ([input_scalar * element for element in input_vector])
    return transformed_vector
```
The script then generates a list of random 3D binary vectors. It performs the XOR operation and the quantum-inspired transformation on these vectors, storing the results in xor_vectors and quantum_vectors respectively.
```python
vectors = [np.random.randint (2, size=3) for _ in range (5)]
xor_vectors = [xor_operation (vectors [i], vectors [(i + 1) % 5]) for i in range (5)]
quantum_vectors = [quantum_transformation (vector, 0.5) for vector in vectors]
```
The script then creates a 3D scatter plot using plotly. It first creates 3D lines for the x, y, and z axes. Then, it adds the vectors from quantum_vectors to the plot. Each vector is represented as a line from the central point to the vector's coordinates, and is assigned a random color.
```python
x_axis = go.Scatter3d (...)
y_axis = go.Scatter3d (...)
z_axis = go.Scatter3d (...)
fig = go.Figure (data=[x_axis, y_axis, z_axis] + [go.Scatter3d (...) for i, vector in enumerate (quantum_vectors)])
```
Finally, the script sets the layout of the figure and displays it. The layout includes a title, axis labels, and a cube aspect ratio.
```python
fig.update_layout (...)
fig.show ()
```
In summary, this script visualizes the process of HSHH Cryptography by generating random 3D vectors, performing XOR operations and quantum-inspired transformations on these vectors, and visualizing the results in a 3D scatter plot.

## Bosonic-Key-Distribution
The provided Python script implements the Bosonic Quantum Key Distribution protocol to generate a secret key between two parties, Alice and Bob, using the quantum computing library, qutip. It also uses numpy for numerical operations and plotly for data visualization.
The script begins by defining a function `create_circuit` which creates a quantum state and applies a Hadamard gate and a measurement operation based on the input parameters. The Hadamard gate is a quantum gate which allows a state to be in a superposition of states, and the measurement operation collapses the quantum state to a definite state.
```python
def create_circuit(hadamard=False, measure=False):
    state = qt.basis (2, 0)
    if hadamard:
        hadamard_gate = qt.Qobj ([[1, 1], [1, -1]]) / np.sqrt (2)
        state = hadamard_gate * state
    if measure:
        state = qt.sigmaz () * state
    return state
```
The function `create_circuit_bob` is used to create an initial quantum state for Bob.
```python
def create_circuit_bob():
    state = qt.basis (2, 0)
    return state
```
The `quantum_channel` function simulates a quantum channel with noise. It takes Alice's quantum state as input, adds some noise to it, and returns the resulting state which represents Bob's state after the channel.
```python
def quantum_channel(alice):
    noise = qt.rand_ket(2)  # Create a random quantum state
    bob_state = alice + 0.3 * noise  # Add the noise to Alice's state
    bob_state = bob_state.unit()  # Normalize the state
    return bob_state
```
The `execute_circuit` function is a placeholder function that returns the input state without performing any operation.
```python
def execute_circuit(state):
    return state
```
The `run` function runs the quantum key distribution protocol. It creates a quantum state for Alice, sends it through the quantum channel to Bob, and then calculates the fidelity of Alice's and Bob's states. The fidelity is a measure of how similar the two quantum states are.
```python
def run():
    alice = create_circuit (hadamard=True, measure=True)
    bob = quantum_channel (alice)
    alice_state = execute_circuit (alice)
    bob_state = execute_circuit (bob)
    fidelity = qt.fidelity (alice_state, bob_state)
    return fidelity
```
The `plot_fidelity` function creates a bar plot of the fidelity using plotly.

```python
def plot_fidelity(fidelity):
    fig = go.Figure (data=go.Bar (y=[fidelity]))
    fig.update_layout (title_text='Fidelity of Quantum States')
    fig.show ()
```
Finally, the script runs the quantum key distribution protocol and plots the fidelity of the quantum states when executed as a standalone script.

```python
if __name__ == "__main__":
    fidelity = run ()
    plot_fidelity (fidelity)
```
In summary, this script demonstrates the process of quantum key distribution using the Bosonic protocol, and visualizes the fidelity of the quantum states of Alice and Bob.

## Bosonic-Finance 
The provided Python script uses the stochastic nature of quantum mechanics to predict the future price of a stock. It uses several libraries including numpy for numerical operations, qutip for quantum computations, pandas_datareader and yfinance for fetching stock data, and matplotlib and plotly for data visualization.
The script defines a class `BosonicFinance` which is initialized with a stock symbol and a date range. During initialization, it fetches the stock data using the `get_data` method and processes it to get the closing prices, calculate the percentage change, drop any NaN values, convert it to a numpy array, and reverse it.
```python
class BosonicFinance:
    def __init__(self, stock, start_date, end_date):
        ...
        self.data = self.get_data ()
        self.stock_data = self.get_stock_data ()
        self.stock_data = self.stock_data ['Close']
        self.stock_data = self.stock_data.pct_change ()
        self.stock_data = self.stock_data.dropna ()
        self.stock_data = self.stock_data.to_numpy ()
        self.stock_data = self.stock_data [::-1]
```
The `create_quantum_state` method creates a quantum state by applying a sigma-x gate to the zero state. The `smooth_data` method smooths the stock data using a rolling mean.
```python
@staticmethod
def create_quantum_state():
    psi = qt.basis (2, 0)
    psi = qt.sigmax () * psi
    return psi

def smooth_data(self, window_size=5):
    self.stock_data = pd.Series (self.stock_data).rolling (window=window_size).mean ().dropna ().to_numpy ()
```
The `measure_quantum_state` method measures the quantum state by applying a rotation matrix and a measurement operator, and calculating the probabilities of the outcomes.
```python
def measure_quantum_state(self, psi):
    probabilities = []
    for theta in np.linspace (0, 2 * np.pi, len (self.stock_data)):
        R = qt.Qobj ([[np.cos (theta / 2), -np.sin (theta / 2)], [np.sin (theta / 2), np.cos (theta / 2)]])
        M = R * qt.qeye (2) * R.dag ()
        probabilities.append (np.abs ((psi.dag () * M * psi)) ** 2)
    return np.array (probabilities)
```
The `forecast` method creates a quantum state, measures it, normalizes the probabilities, and uses them to randomly select future stock prices from the historical data.
```python
def forecast(self):
    psi = self.create_quantum_state ()
    probabilities = self.measure_quantum_state (psi)
    probabilities = probabilities / np.sum (probabilities)
    forecasted_data = np.random.choice (self.stock_data, size=8, p=probabilities)
    return forecasted_data
```
The `plot_predicted_stock_price` method plots the historical, forecasted, and actual stock prices, and calculates the mean absolute error of the forecast.
```python
def plot_predicted_stock_price(self):
    forecasted_data = self.forecast ()
    forecast_dates = self.data.index [-len (forecasted_data):]
    actual_data = self.stock_data [::-1] [-len (forecasted_data):]
    ...
    mae = np.mean (np.abs (forecasted_data - actual_data))
    print (f'Mean Absolute Error: {mae}')
```
Finally, an instance of `BosonicFinance` is created for the Apple stock, the data is smoothed, and the stock data and predicted stock price are plotted.
```python
bosonic_finance = BosonicFinance ('AAPL', dt.datetime (2020, 1, 1), dt.datetime (2023, 12, 31))
bosonic_finance.smooth_data (window_size=5)
bosonic_finance.plot_stock_data ()
bosonic_finance.plot_predicted_stock_price ()
```
In summary, this script fetches historical stock data, uses quantum mechanics to predict future stock prices, and visualizes the results.

## Bosonic-Quantum-machine-learning
The provided Python script demonstrates the use of quantum computing to perform matrix multiplication and compares the result with classical matrix multiplication. It uses the libraries numpy for numerical operations, qiskit for quantum computing, and plotly for data visualization.

The script starts by defining a class `Matrix` that represents a matrix with basic operations such as addition, subtraction, and multiplication. The class also includes methods for string representation, equality checks, and accessing and setting elements.
```python
class Matrix:
    def __init__(self, matrix):
        self.matrix = matrix
        self.shape = matrix.shape
    ...
```
The function `quantum_matrix_multiplication` is defined to perform matrix multiplication using a quantum circuit. It creates a quantum circuit on two qubits, applies the unitary operator corresponding to the input matrices `A` and `B`, measures the qubits, and uses the qasm simulator to get the measurement probabilities.
```python
def quantum_matrix_multiplication(A, B):
    qc = QuantumCircuit (2)
    qc.unitary (Operator (A), [0, 1])
    qc.unitary (Operator (B), [0, 1])
    qc.measure_all ()
    simulator = Aer.get_backend ('qasm_simulator')
    result = execute (qc, simulator, shots=10000).result ()
    counts = result.get_counts (qc)
    return counts
```
The script then defines matrices `A` and `B` as instances of the `Matrix` class, performs matrix multiplication using the quantum circuit and classical matrix multiplication, and prints the results.
```python
A = Matrix (np.array ([[1, 2], [3, 4]]))
B = Matrix (np.array ([[5, 6], [7, 8]]))
counts = quantum_matrix_multiplication (A, B)
C = A * B
```
Finally, the script uses plotly to create a bar plot comparing the results of quantum and classical matrix multiplication.
```python
fig = go.Figure (data=[
    go.Bar (name='Quantum', x=list (counts.keys ()), y=list (counts.values ())),
    go.Bar (name='Classical', x=list (C.matrix.flatten ()), y=list (C.matrix.flatten ()))
])
```
In summary, this script demonstrates how to use quantum computing to perform matrix multiplication and compares the result with classical matrix multiplication.
