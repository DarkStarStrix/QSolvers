# How the Solvers work

## Grover's algorithm
using the Qiskit library in Python. Grover's algorithm is a quantum algorithm that finds with high probability the unique input to a black box function that produces a particular output value, using just O(sqrt(N)) evaluations of the function, where N is the size of the function's domain.
The first part of the code imports necessary libraries from Qiskit, loads the IBM Q account, and selects the least busy backend device that has at least 3 qubits and is operational.

```python
from qiskit import QuantumCircuit, execute, Aer, IBMQ
from qiskit.providers.ibmq import least_busy
from qiskit.visualization import plot_histogram

provider = IBMQ.load_account()
backend = least_busy(provider.backends(filters=lambda x: x.configuration().n_qubits >= 3 and
                                   not x.configuration().simulator and x.status().operational))
```

Next, a quantum circuit is created with 3 qubits and 3 classical bits. The Hadamard gate is applied to all qubits to create a superposition of all possible states.

```python
qc = QuantumCircuit(3, 3)
qc.h(range(3))
```

The Oracle is then applied. This part of the code flips the sign of the state we are searching for. In this case, the Oracle is hard-coded to flip the sign of the state `|111>`.

```python
qc.x(range(3))
qc.h(2)
qc.ccx(0, 1, 2)
qc.h(2)
qc.x(range(3))
```

The Grover diffusion operator is applied next. This part of the code amplifies the probability of the state we are searching for.

```python
qc.h(range(3))
qc.x(range(3))
qc.h(2)
qc.ccx(0, 1, 2)
qc.h(2)
qc.x(range(3))
qc.h(range(3))
```

The qubits are then measured and the results are stored in the classical bits.

```python
qc.measure(range(3), range(3))
```

Finally, the quantum circuit is executed on the selected backend, the results are retrieved, and a histogram of the results is plotted.

```python
job = execute(qc, backend, shots=1024)
result = job.result()
counts = result.get_counts(qc)
plot_histogram(counts)
```

In summary, this code is a complete implementation of Grover's algorithm for 3 qubits using the Qiskit library. It creates a quantum circuit, applies the Oracle and Grover diffusion operator, measures the qubits, and plots the results.

##  Shor's algorithm 

Shor's algorithm is a quantum algorithm for integer factorization, which underlies the security of many cryptographic systems.
The first part of the code imports necessary libraries from Qiskit, loads the IBM Q account, and selects the least busy backend device that has at least 3 qubits and is operational.

```python
from qiskit import QuantumCircuit, execute, Aer, IBMQ
from qiskit.providers.ibmq import least_busy
from qiskit.visualization import plot_histogram
import numpy as np

provider = IBMQ.load_account()
backend = least_busy(provider.backends(filters=lambda x: x.configuration().n_qubits >= 3 and
                                                           not x.configuration().simulator and x.status().operational))
```

Next, a quantum circuit is created with 3 qubits and 3 classical bits. The Hadamard gate is applied to all qubits to create a superposition of all possible states.

```python
qc = QuantumCircuit(3, 3)
qc.h(range(3))
```

The Oracle is then applied. This part of the code flips the sign of the state we are searching for. In this case, the Oracle is hard-coded to flip the sign of the state `|111>`.

```python
qc.x(range(3))
qc.h(2)
qc.ccx(0, 1, 2)
qc.h(2)
qc.x(range(2))
```

The Shor's algorithm is applied next. This part of the code amplifies the probability of the state we are searching for.

```python
qc.h(range(3))
qc.measure(range(3), range(3))
```

Finally, the quantum circuit is executed on the selected backend, the results are retrieved, and a histogram of the results is plotted.

```python
job = execute(qc, backend, shots=1024)
result = job.result()
counts = result.get_counts(qc)
plot_histogram(counts)
```

In summary, this code is a complete implementation of Shor's algorithm for 3 qubits using the Qiskit library. It creates a quantum circuit, applies the Oracle and Shor's algorithm, measures the qubits, and plots the results.

##  Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE) 
The variational quantum eigensolver (VQE) is a quantum algorithm that can be used to find the ground state energy of a molecule or other quantum system. It combines a quantum circuit with a classical optimizer to minimize the energy of the system.
The first part of the code imports necessary libraries from Qiskit and numpy. It also loads the IBM Q account and selects the least busy backend device that has at least 3 qubits and is operational.

```python
from qiskit import QuantumCircuit, execute, Aer, IBMQ
from qiskit.visualization import plot_histogram
from qiskit.aqua.algorithms import VQE
from qiskit.aqua.components.optimizers import COBYLA
from qiskit.aqua.components.variational_forms import RY
from qiskit.aqua.operators import WeightedPauliOperator
import numpy as np

provider = IBMQ.load_account()
backend = least_busy(provider.backends(filters=lambda x: x.configuration().n_qubits >= 3 and
                                       not x.configuration().simulator and x.status().operational))
```

Next, a quantum circuit is created with 3 qubits and 3 classical bits. The Hadamard gate is applied to all qubits to create a superposition of all possible states. An Oracle is then applied which flips the sign of the state we are searching for.

```python
qc = QuantumCircuit(3, 3)
qc.h(range(3))
qc.x(range(3))
qc.h(2)
qc.ccx(0, 1, 2)
qc.h(2)
qc.x(range(3))
```

The VQE algorithm is then applied. This part of the code defines the Hamiltonian, the variational form, and the optimizer. The Hamiltonian is defined using a dictionary of Pauli operators, the variational form is defined using the RY gate, and the optimizer is defined using the COBYLA method.

```python
pauli_dict = {
    'paulis': [{"coeff": {"imag": 0.0, "real": -1.052373245772859}, "label": "II"},
              {"coeff": {"imag": 0.0, "real": 0.39793742484318045}, "label": "ZI"},
              {"coeff": {"imag": 0.0, "real": -0.39793742484318045}, "label": "IZ"},
              {"coeff": {"imag": 0.0, "real": -0.01128010425623538}, "label": "ZZ"},
              {"coeff": {"imag": 0.0, "real": 0.18093119978423156}, "label": "XX"}]
}
qubit_op = WeightedPauliOperator.from_dict(pauli_dict)
var_form = RY(qubit_op.num_qubits, depth=3, entanglement='linear')
optimizer = COBYLA(maxiter=1000)
vqe = VQE(qubit_op, var_form, optimizer)
```

Finally, the quantum circuit is executed on the selected backend, the results are retrieved, and a histogram of the results is plotted. The VQE algorithm is then executed on the backend.

```python
job = execute(qc, backend, shots=1024)
result = job.result()
counts = result.get_counts(qc)
plot_histogram(counts)
result = vqe.run(backend)
```

In summary, this code is a complete implementation of the VQE algorithm for 3 qubits using the Qiskit library. It creates a quantum circuit, applies the Oracle and VQE algorithm, measures the qubits, plots the results, and executes the VQE algorithm.

##  Boson Sampling
Boson Sampling is a type of quantum computing algorithm that is used to simulate the behavior of photons in a linear optical system.
The code begins by importing the necessary libraries: numpy for numerical computations, QuTiP (Quantum Toolbox in Python) for quantum computations, and plotly for data visualization.

```python
import numpy as np
import qutip as qt
import plotly.graph_objects as go
```
A class named `BosonSampling` is defined with three methods: `__init__`, `simulate`, and `plot`. The `__init__` method initializes the class with three parameters: `n` (the number of photons), `m` (the number of modes), and `U` (the unitary matrix representing the linear optical system). The unitary matrix `U` is converted into a tensor product of quantum objects using the `qt.tensor` and `qt.Qobj` functions from the QuTiP library.

```python
class BosonSampling:
    def __init__(self, n, m, U):
        self.n = n
        self.m = m
        self.U = qt.tensor ([qt.Qobj (U) for _ in range (self.n)])
```
The `simulate` method creates an initial state as a tensor product of basis states, applies the unitary transformation `U` to this state, and returns the absolute square of the final state, which represents the probability distribution of the output states.

```python
def simulate(self):
    initial_state = qt.tensor ([qt.basis (self.m, 0) for _ in range (self.n)])
    final_state = self.U * initial_state
    return abs (final_state.full ()) ** 2
```
The `plot` method creates a bar plot of the output state probabilities using the plotly library.

```python
def plot(self, prob):
    fig = go.Figure ()
    fig.add_trace (go.Bar (x=list (range (self.m)), y=prob [0]))
    fig.update_layout (title="Boson Sampling", xaxis_title="Output state", yaxis_title="Probability")
    fig.show ()
```
In the main part of the code, an instance of the `BosonSampling` class is created with `n=3` photons, `m=5` modes, and a random unitary matrix `U`. The `simulate` method is called to compute the output state probabilities, and the `plot` method is called to visualize these probabilities.

```python
if __name__ == "__main__":
    n = 3
    m = 5
    U = np.random.rand (m, m) + 1j * np.random.rand (m, m)
    boson_sampling = BosonSampling (n, m, U)
    prob = boson_sampling.simulate ()
    boson_sampling.plot (prob)
    print (prob)
```

In summary, this code is a complete implementation of Boson Sampling for a given number of photons and modes using the QuTiP library in Python. It creates a BosonSampling object, simulates the behavior of photons in a linear optical system, and visualizes the output state probabilities.


The first part of the code imports the necessary libraries and modules. The BosonSampling class is imported from the Quantum_Walk_Solvers library, numpy is imported for numerical computations, and matplotlib.pyplot is imported for data visualization.

```python
from Quantum_Walk_Solvers.Boson_Sampling import BosonSampling
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
```
Next, an instance of the BosonSampling class is created with `n=3` photons, `m=5` modes, and a random unitary matrix `U`. The `simulate` method is then called on this instance to compute the output state probabilities.
```python
n = 3
m = 5
U = np.random.rand(m, m) + 1j * np.random.rand(m, m)
boson_sampling = BosonSampling(n, m, U)
prob = boson_sampling.simulate()
```

The code then analyzes the output state probabilities by computing the mean, median, standard deviation, and variance using numpy's built-in functions. These statistics are printed to the console.

```python
mean = np.mean(prob)
median = np.median(prob)
std_dev = np.std(prob)
variance = np.var(prob)

print(f"Mean: {mean}")
print(f"Median: {median}")
print(f"Standard Deviation: {std_dev}")
print(f"Variance: {variance}")
```

Finally, the code creates a histogram of the output state probabilities using matplotlib. The histogram has 20 bins, a title, labels for the x and y axes, and a grid.

```python
plt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))
plt.hist(prob, bins=20, alpha=0.7, color='skyblue', edgecolor='black')
plt.title('Probability Distribution')
plt.xlabel('Probability')
plt.ylabel('Frequency')
plt.grid(True)
plt.show()
```

In summary, this code is a complete implementation of Boson Sampling simulation, analysis, and visualization in Python. It creates a BosonSampling object, simulates the Boson Sampling, analyzes the output state probabilities, and visualizes these probabilities as a histogram.

## Quantum Random Number Generator (QRNG). 
The Quantum Random Number Generator (QRNG) is a quantum algorithm that generates random numbers based on the principles of quantum mechanics. It uses a quantum state to generate random numbers, which are inherently random due to the probabilistic nature of quantum mechanics.
The QRNG is encapsulated in a class named `QuantumRandomNumberGenerator`. this quantum random number generator uses a quantum state to generate random numbers.
The class is initialized with a single parameter `n`, which represents the number of qubits. In the `__init__` method, a density matrix of a quantum state is created using the `qutip.rand_dm` function. This density matrix is then normalized and converted into a full matrix and a numpy array.

```python
def __init__(self, n):
    self.n = n
    self.qubits = qutip.rand_dm (2 ** n, density=1)
    self.qubits = self.qubits.unit ()
    self.qubits = self.qubits.ptrace (0)
    self.qubits = self.qubits.full ()
    self.qubits = np.array (self.qubits)
```

The `get_random_number` method generates a random number based on the quantum state. It calculates the absolute values of the quantum state, normalizes them to get probabilities, and then uses numpy's `random.choice` function to generate a random number based on these probabilities.

```python
def get_random_number(self):
    abs_qubits = np.absolute (self.qubits [0])
    probabilities = abs_qubits / np.sum (abs_qubits)
    return np.random.choice ([0, 1], p=probabilities)
```

The `get_random_numbers` method generates a specified number of random numbers by calling the `get_random_number` method in a loop.

```python
def get_random_numbers(self, num):
    return [self.get_random_number () for _ in range (num)]
```

The `plot_probability_distribution` method visualizes the probability distribution of the quantum state using a bar plot from the plotly library.

```python
def plot_probability_distribution(self):
    abs_qubits = np.absolute (self.qubits [0])
    probabilities = abs_qubits / np.sum (abs_qubits)
    states = np.arange (len (probabilities))  # create an array of states
    fig = px.bar (x=states, y=probabilities, title='Probability Distribution')
    fig.update_layout (xaxis_title='State', yaxis_title='Probability')
    fig.show ()
```

The `plot_heatmap` method visualizes the density matrix of the quantum state using a heatmap from the plotly library.

```python
def plot_heatmap(self):
    density_matrix = np.absolute(self.qubits)
    # Create labels for the axes
    labels = [f'State {i}' for i in range(len(density_matrix))]
    fig = go.Figure(data=go.Heatmap(z=density_matrix, x=labels, y=labels))
    fig.update_layout(title='Heatmap of Density Matrix')
    fig.show()
```

In the main part of the code, an instance of the `QuantumRandomNumberGenerator` class is created with `n=3` qubits. The probability distribution and the heatmap of the quantum state are then plotted.

```python
n = 3
q = QuantumRandomNumberGenerator (n)
q.plot_probability_distribution ()
q.plot_heatmap ()
```

In summary, this code is a complete implementation of a Quantum Random Number Generator in Python. It creates a QRNG object, generates random numbers based on the quantum state, and visualizes the probability distribution and the density matrix of the quantum state.

## Bernstein-Vazirani algorithm
The Bernstein-Vazirani algorithm is a quantum algorithm that is used to find a hidden integer from a black box function. The algorithm is encapsulated in a class named `BernsteinVaziraniAlgorithm`.
The first part of the code imports necessary libraries from Qiskit, which is a Python library for quantum computing.

```python
from qiskit import QuantumCircuit, ClassicalRegister, QuantumRegister
from qiskit import execute, Aer
```

Next, a quantum circuit is created with 3 qubits and 3 classical bits. 

```python
q = QuantumRegister(3)
c = ClassicalRegister(3)
qc = QuantumCircuit(q, c)
```

The Hadamard gate is applied to each qubit to create a superposition of all possible states.

```python
for qubit in q:
    qc.h(qubit)
```

A barrier is then applied. This is used to separate different parts of the circuit and does not affect the results.

```python
qc.barrier()
```

The inner-product oracle is then applied. This part of the code flips the sign of the state we are searching for.

```python
qc.cx(q[0], q[2])
qc.cx(q[1], q[2])
```

Another barrier is applied before the Hadamard gate is applied to each qubit again.

```python
qc.barrier()
for qubit in q:
    qc.h(qubit)
```

The qubits are then measured and the results are stored in the classical bits.

```python
for i in range(3):
    qc.measure(q[i], c[i])
```

Finally, the quantum circuit is executed on a simulator backend, the results are retrieved, and printed.

```python
backend_sim = Aer.get_backend('qasm_simulator')
job_sim = execute(qc, backend_sim)
result_sim = job_sim.result()
print("simulation: ", result_sim)
print(result_sim.get_counts(qc))
```

In summary, this code is a complete implementation of the Bernstein-Vazirani algorithm for 3 qubits using the Qiskit library. It creates a quantum circuit, applies the Hadamard gate and the inner-product oracle, measures the qubits, and retrieves and prints the results.

## Quantum Fourier Transform (QFT)
its inverse, and a method called Quantum Fourier Fishing for a given state vector. It also includes a function to check the equality of two quantum states.
The `qft` function creates a Quantum Fourier Transform circuit on `n` qubits. It starts by initializing a quantum circuit with `n` qubits. Then, it applies a series of Hadamard gates and controlled phase rotation gates to the qubits.

```python
def qft(n):
    """Create a Quantum Fourier Transform circuit on n qubits."""
    circuit = QuantumCircuit (n)
    for j in range (n):
        for k in range (j):
            circuit.cu1 (np.pi / float (2 ** (j - k)), k, j)
        circuit.h (j)
    return circuit
```

The `inverse_qft` function creates an inverse Quantum Fourier Transform circuit on `n` qubits. It also starts by initializing a quantum circuit with `n` qubits. Then, it applies a series of Hadamard gates and controlled phase rotation gates with negative angles to the qubits.

```python
def inverse_qft(n):
    """Create an inverse Quantum Fourier Transform circuit on n qubits."""
    circuit = QuantumCircuit (n)
    for j in range (n):
        circuit.h (j)
        for k in range (j):
            circuit.cu1 (-np.pi / float (2 ** (j - k)), k, j)
    return circuit
```

The `quantum_fourier_fishing` function performs Quantum Fourier Fishing on a state vector. It creates a quantum circuit, initializes the circuit with the state vector, applies the QFT, performs a measurement on all qubits, and executes the circuit on a simulator backend. The function returns the counts of the measurement results.

```python
def quantum_fourier_fishing(n, state_vector):
    """Perform Quantum Fourier Fishing on a state vector."""
    # Create a quantum circuit
    circuit = QuantumCircuit (n)
    # Initialize the circuit with the state vector
    circuit.initialize (state_vector, range (n))
    # Apply the QFT
    circuit.append (qft (n), range (n))
    # Perform a measurement
    circuit.measure_all ()
    # Execute the circuit
    result = execute (circuit, Aer.get_backend ('qasm_simulator')).result ()
    counts = result.get_counts (circuit)
    return counts
```

The `fourier_checking` function checks if the actual counts match the expected counts. It simply compares the two input dictionaries and returns `True` if they are equal and `False` otherwise.

```python
def fourier_checking(expected_counts, actual_counts):
    """Check if the actual counts match the expected counts."""
    return expected_counts == actual_counts
```

In summary, this code is a complete implementation of the Quantum Fourier Transform and its inverse, Quantum Fourier Fishing, and Fourier Checking in Python. It creates quantum circuits, applies the QFT and its inverse, performs Quantum Fourier Fishing on a state vector, and checks the equality of two quantum states.

## Deutsch-Jozsa algorithm for 3 qubits.
The Deutsch-Jozsa algorithm is a quantum algorithm that can determine whether a function is constant or balanced with only one query, which is a significant improvement over classical algorithms.
The script begins by importing necessary libraries from Qiskit, which is a Python library for quantum computing.

```python
from qiskit import QuantumCircuit, execute, Aer, IBMQ
from qiskit.providers.ibmq import least_busy
from qiskit.visualization import plot_histogram
```

Next, it loads an IBM Q account and gets the least busy backend device that has at least 3 qubits, is not a simulator, and is operational.

```python
provider = IBMQ.load_account()
backend = least_busy(provider.backends(filters=lambda x: x.configuration().n_qubits >= 3 and
                                       not x.configuration().simulator and x.status().operational))
```

A quantum circuit is then created with 3 qubits and 3 classical bits.

```python
qc = QuantumCircuit(3, 3)
```

The Hadamard gate is applied to all qubits to create a superposition of all possible states.

```python
qc.h(range(3))
```

An oracle is then applied to the qubits. This oracle is a black box function that flips the sign of the state we are searching for.

```python
qc.x(range(3))
qc.h(2)
qc.ccx(0, 1, 2)
qc.h(2)
qc.x(range(3))
```

The qubits are then measured and the results are stored in the classical bits.

```python
qc.measure(range(3), range(3))
```

The quantum circuit is then executed on the least busy backend, the results are retrieved, and a histogram of the results is plotted.

```python
job = execute(qc, backend, shots=1024)
result = job.result()
counts = result.get_counts(qc)
plot_histogram(counts)
```

Finally, the quantum circuit is printed to the console.

```python
print(qc)
```

In summary, this code is a complete implementation of the Deutsch-Jozsa algorithm for 3 qubits using the Qiskit library. It creates a quantum circuit, applies the Hadamard gate and the oracle, measures the qubits, and retrieves and visualizes the results.

## Simon's algorithm.
Simon's algorithm is a quantum algorithm used to solve a specific black box problem, known as Simon's problem, with a quadratic speedup over the best known classical algorithms.
The script begins by importing necessary libraries from Qiskit, which is a Python library for quantum computing, and numpy for numerical computations.

```python
import numpy as np
from qiskit import QuantumCircuit, execute, Aer, IBMQ
from qiskit.visualization import plot_histogram
from qiskit.aqua.algorithms import Simon
from qiskit.aqua.components.oracles import TruthTableOracle
```

Next, it loads an IBM Q account and gets the backend device 'ibmq_qasm_simulator'.

```python
provider = IBMQ.load_account()
backend = provider.get_backend('ibmq_qasm_simulator')
```

The length of the input string is set to 4.

```python
n = 4
```

An oracle is then set up using the `TruthTableOracle` class from Qiskit. Simon's algorithm is a black-box algorithm, so we don't need to know the details of the oracle. The oracle is set to '0011'.

```python
oracle = TruthTableOracle('0011')
```

A Simon algorithm instance is then created with the oracle.

```python
simon = Simon(oracle)
```

The algorithm is then run on the backend and the result is retrieved.

```python
result = simon.run(backend)
```

The result is then printed to the console.

```python
print(result['result'])
```

A histogram of the result is then plotted.

```python
plot_histogram(result['measurement'])
```

Finally, the quantum circuit used in the Simon algorithm is printed to the console.

```python
print(simon.construct_circuit(measurement=True))
```

In summary, this code is a complete implementation of Simon's algorithm using the Qiskit library. It creates a Simon algorithm instance, runs the algorithm on a backend, retrieves and prints the results, and visualizes the results as a histogram.

## QBlueprintCircuit
The `QBlueprintCircuit` class is a blueprint for creating custom quantum circuits in Qiskit. It provides methods for adding gates, barriers, measurements, and visualizing the circuit.

The `CustomQuantumAlgorithm` class is initialized with a number of qubits. In the `__init__` method, it creates a list of `Qubit` and `Clbit` objects equal to the number of qubits specified. These are then added to the quantum circuit using the `add_register` method.

```python
def __init__(self, qubits):
    super().__init__(name="Custom Quantum Algorithm")
    self.qubits = [Qubit() for _ in range(qubits)]
    self.clbits = [Clbit() for _ in range(qubits)]
    self.add_register(*self.qubits)
    self.add_register(*self.clbits)
```

The class also has `add_gate` method, which appends a specified gate to a specified qubit in the quantum circuit.

```python
def add_gate(self, gate, qubit):
    self.append(gate, [self.qubits[qubit]])
```

The `run` method executes the quantum circuit on a simulator and returns the result. It uses the `execute` function from Qiskit to run the circuit on the 'qasm_simulator' backend. The result of the execution is then returned as a dictionary of counts.

```python
def run(self):
    simulator = Aer.get_backend('qasm_simulator')
    job = execute(self, simulator)
    result = job.result()
    return result.get_counts(self)
```

## Quantum energy solver
The `QuantumSolver` class is a blueprint for solving quantum problems using the Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE) algorithm in Qiskit. It provides methods for creating a Hamiltonian, initializing the VQE algorithm, and computing the minimum eigenvalue. 
this solver is meant to solve a quantum problem by finding the minimum energy configuration of a system.

```python
@qubits.setter
def qubits(self, value):
    self._qubits = value

@clbits.setter
def clbits(self, value):
    self._clbits = value
```

In the main part of the script, an instance of `CustomQuantumAlgorithm` is created with 2 qubits. A Hadamard gate (`HGate`) is added to the first qubit, and then the quantum algorithm is run and the result is printed.

```python
custom_algo = CustomQuantumAlgorithm(2)
custom_algo.add_gate(HGate(), 0)
print(custom_algo.run())
```

This code provides a basic framework for creating and running custom quantum algorithms using Qiskit. It can be extended and modified to suit more complex use cases.

The provided Python code uses the Qiskit library to solve a quantum problem. The main component of the code is the `QuantumSolver` class.

The `QuantumSolver` class is initialized with several parameters, including `loss_coefficients`, `num_qubits`, `reps`, and `maxiter`. The `loss_coefficients` are used to create a Hamiltonian, which is a function that describes the total energy of the system. This is done in the `create_hamiltonian` method:

```python
@staticmethod
def create_hamiltonian(loss_coefficients):
    return sum (coeff * (I ^ I ^ (Z - I)) for coeff in loss_coefficients)
```

The `num_qubits` parameter specifies the number of qubits to be used in the quantum circuit. The `reps` parameter specifies the number of repetitions of the circuit to be performed. The `maxiter` parameter specifies the maximum number of iterations for the optimizer.

The `__init__` method of the `QuantumSolver` class initializes several important components of the quantum algorithm. It creates a quantum instance using the Aer simulator, an ansatz (a guess for the quantum state that minimizes the energy), an optimizer, and a Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE) instance:

```python
def __init__(self, loss_coefficients, num_qubits=3, reps=1, maxiter=100):
    self.loss_coefficients = loss_coefficients
    self.H_loss = self.create_hamiltonian (self.loss_coefficients)
    self.quantum_instance = QuantumInstance (Aer.get_backend ('aer_simulator_statevector'))
    self.ansatz = EfficientSU2 (num_qubits=num_qubits, reps=reps)
    self.optimizer = SPSA (maxiter=maxiter)
    self.vqe = VQE (self.ansatz, self.optimizer, quantum_instance=self.quantum_instance)
```

The `compute_minimum_eigenvalue` method runs the VQE algorithm on the Hamiltonian and returns the real part of the minimum eigenvalue, which corresponds to the minimum energy of the system:

```python
def compute_minimum_eigenvalue(self):
    result = self.vqe.compute_minimum_eigenvalue (operator=self.H_loss)
    return result.eigenvalue.real
```

In the main part of the script, an instance of `QuantumSolver` is created with specific loss coefficients. The minimum eigenvalue (energy) is then computed and printed:

```python
solver = QuantumSolver ([1.2, 0.9, 1.5])
print (f"Minimum Loss Configuration Energy: {solver.compute_minimum_eigenvalue ()}")
```

This code provides a basic framework for solving quantum problems using the VQE algorithm in Qiskit. It can be extended and modified to suit more complex use cases.

## Quantum Optics Solvers
The provided Python code uses the QuTiP library, a quantum computing toolbox, to create a quantum circuit that generates a W-state, a specific quantum state of multiple qubits. It then calculates the probabilities of the basis states and visualizes them using the Plotly library.

The function `w_state_circuit()` is where the quantum circuit is created. A `QubitCircuit` object is initialized with 3 qubits. Then, a sequence of quantum gates is added to the circuit: a "SNOT" gate (also known as a Hadamard gate) is applied to the first qubit, and two "CNOT" gates (controlled NOT gates) are applied with the first and second qubits as controls and the second and third qubits as targets, respectively.

```python
def w_state_circuit():
    qc = QubitCircuit (3)
    qc.add_gate ("SNOT", targets=[0])
    qc.add_gate ("CNOT", controls=[0], targets=[1])
    qc.add_gate ("CNOT", controls=[1], targets=[2])
    ...
```

The initial state of the system is set to be the tensor product of three qubits, all in the state |0⟩. The `gate_sequence_product` function is used to calculate the unitary matrix `U` that represents the entire quantum circuit.

```python
    initial_state = qt.tensor (qt.basis (2, 0), qt.basis (2, 0), qt.basis (2, 0))
    U = gate_sequence_product (qc.propagators ())
    return U * initial_state
```

The W-state is then calculated by applying the unitary matrix `U` to the initial state. The probabilities of the basis states are calculated by taking the absolute square of the state vector.

```python
w_state = w_state_circuit ()
probabilities = np.abs (w_state.full ()) ** 2
```

Finally, the probabilities are visualized using Plotly. A scatter plot is created for each basis state, with the x-coordinate being the basis state and the y-coordinate being the corresponding probability.

```python
fig = go.Figure ()
for i, basis_state in enumerate (["000", "001", "010", "100"]):
    fig.add_trace (go.Scatter (x=[0], y=[probabilities [i] [0]], mode="lines+markers", name=f"|{basis_state}⟩"))
...
fig.show ()
```

This code provides a basic example of how to create a quantum circuit, calculate the resulting quantum state, and visualize the probabilities of the basis states using QuTiP and Plotly.

## Quantum Clock Solvers
The provided code is a Python script that simulates a quantum clock using the QuTiP library. The main class in this script is `QuantumClock`, which represents a quantum clock system.

The `QuantumClock` class is initialized with a number of ions, which defaults to 1. Each ion is represented as a quantum state, initialized in the ground state (`qt.basis(2, 0)`). The Hamiltonian of the system is the sum of the Pauli X operator (`qt.sigmax()`) applied to each ion.

```python
class QuantumClock:
    def __init__(self, num_ions=1):
        self.num_ions = num_ions
        self.ions = [qt.basis (2, 0) for _ in range (num_ions)]
        self.hamiltonian = sum (qt.sigmax () for _ in self.ions)
```

The `evolve` method evolves the system from its initial state over a given time period. It uses the `qt.mesolve` function from QuTiP to solve the master equation for the system, with the Hamiltonian and initial state as inputs. The function returns the final state of the system.

```python
def evolve(self, time):
    initial_state = qt.tensor (self.ions)
    result = qt.mesolve (self.hamiltonian, initial_state, [0, time])
    return result.states [-1]
```

The `measure_time` method measures the probability of finding the system in the excited state after a given time period. It evolves the system over the time period, then calculates the absolute square of the coefficient of the excited state in the final state.

```python
def measure_time(self, time):
    final_state = self.evolve (time)
    return np.abs (final_state [1]) ** 2
```

The `plot_time_evolution` method plots the probability of the system being in the excited state over a range of times. It uses the Plotly library to create the plot.

```python
def plot_time_evolution(self, max_time=10):
    times = np.linspace (0, max_time, 100)
    probabilities = [self.measure_time (t) for t in times]

    fig = go.Figure ()
    fig.add_trace (go.Scatter (x=times, y=probabilities, mode='lines', name='Excited State Probability'))
    fig.update_layout (title='Quantum Clock Time Evolution', xaxis_title='Time', yaxis_title='Probability')
    fig.show ()
```

Finally, an instance of the `QuantumClock` class is created with one ion, and the time evolution of the system is plotted over a time period of 10 units.

```python
clock = QuantumClock (num_ions=1)
clock.plot_time_evolution (max_time=10)
```
